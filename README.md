:lock: Bitcoin Password Generator
=========================================

Usage & description
--------------------
The recommended password length today is 8 - 10 characters long. To ensure that your account is secured, use a strong password. A strong password must have the following traits:

- make it long (15+)
- Use a mix of characters
- Avoid common substitutions 
- avoid using memorable keyboard paths (ex: asdfg, qwerty)

This is a simple python script that generates a random password and employs all the traits above. The character length is determined by the user input.
